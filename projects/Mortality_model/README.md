# Mortality Model

## Objective

The Mortality Model is designed to predict patient outcomes using various clinical data points. This document outlines the setup and requirements needed to utilize the model effectively.

## RCLIF Tables required
The following tables from the RCLIF database are required for the Mortality Model. Each table must include the specified fields below: 

* **patient_demographics** (`encounter_id`, `race`, `ethnicity`, `sex`)
* **encounter_demographics_dispo** (`encounter_id`, `age_at_admission`, `disposition`)
* **limited_identifiers** (`encounter_id`, `admission_dttm`)
* **adt** (`encounter_id`, `location_category`, `in_dttm`, `out_dttm`)
* **vitals** (`encounter_id`, `recorded_dttm`, `vital_category`, `vital_value`) 
    * `vital_category` must include `weight_kg`, `pulse`, `sbp`, `dbp`, `temp_c`,`height_inches`
* **labs** (`encounter_id`, `lab_order_dttm`, `lab_category`, `lab_value`, `lab_type_name`) 
    * `lab_category` must include  'albumin', 'alkaline_phosphatase', 'ast', 'basophil', 'bilirubin_conjugated', 'bilirubin_total', 'calcium', 'chloride', 'hemoglobin', 'lymphocyte', 'monocyte', 'glucose_serum',  'neutrophil', 'potassium', 'sodium', 'total_protein','platelet count', 'wbc'. 

Note- 
1. Make sure that the `lab_type_name` is correctly labelled as either "standard", "poc", etc. We filter for "standard" labs for this project.
2. Ensure that all the labs mentioned above are present in your dataset. The model will not run if any of these are missing. 
4. Please confirm the race and ethnicity mapping for your data is correctly mapped. 


## Setup instructions

### Direct Package Installation 

If you don't want to create a virtual env, you can run the below command in the terminal or jupyter notebook. 
```
!{sys.executable} -m pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn lightgbm matplotlib duckdb 
```

### Creating and Activating a Virtual Environment and RUN!!!!!!!
Follow these steps to create a virtual environment.
1. In the Mortality_Model directory, Open terminal & run the `setup_mortality_model.sh`(mac) or `setup_mortality_model.bat` (win) script in terminal to set up a virtual environment for this project. 
    Mac Setup: 
    ```
        chmod +x setup_mortality_model.sh
        ./setup_mortality_model.sh
     ```
   Win Setup
     ```
        ./setup_mortality_model.bat
     ```
2.  Activate the virtual environment by running the below command in the terminal
    ```
    source .mortality_model/bin/activate
    ```
3. Select the new kernel `Python (mortality_model)` in your Jupyter notebook.

Ready to run the Inference_py/Inference_R notebook to run the model (Avaliable in .pkl, .json & .txt )!
